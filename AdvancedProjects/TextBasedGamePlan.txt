Plan for a Simple Text-Based Adventure Game in C++

World Design:

    Setting: Choose a theme for your game (e.g., fantasy, sci-fi, mystery).

    Locations: Create a map of interconnected locations (rooms) the player can visit. Include a starting location and an ending goal. Each location should have a descriptive text that sets the scene and mentions any noteworthy features.
    Objects: Define objects that can be found in these locations. Some might be usable (e.g., key to unlock a door), while others might provide clues or backstory (e.g., diary entry).
    Characters (Optional): Consider including characters the player can interact with. These characters could provide information, offer quests, or even pose obstacles.

Gameplay Mechanics:

    Player Actions: Determine the basic actions the player can perform (e.g., look, go (north/south/etc.), take, use, talk).
    Inventory: Decide if the player can carry objects. If so, create a system to track inventory items and their descriptions.
    Combat (Optional): If your game involves combat, design a simple combat system (e.g., turn-based attack/defense with health points).
Implementation:

    Data Structures: Use a data structure (e.g., structs or classes) to represent locations, objects, and characters. Each should have relevant properties (e.g., location description, object name/usability, character name/dialogue).
    User Input: Utilize C++ input functions (e.g., cin) to take user commands and parse them into actions and directions.
    Branching Narratives: Write different descriptions and events based on the player's choices (e.g., different dialogue based on using or not using an object).
    Game Loop: Create a loop that continuously displays the current location description, accepts player commands, and updates the game state based on those commands.

Testing and Expansion:

    Playtest: Test your game thoroughly to identify and fix bugs or logical inconsistencies.
    Expansion: Once you have a basic framework, consider adding more features:
        Puzzles and riddles for the player to solve.
        Multiple endings based on player choices.
        Inventory management system with weight limits.
        More complex combat mechanics.
